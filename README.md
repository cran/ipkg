# Introduction

When you want to install an R package on GitHub, but you canâ€™t access GitHub, 
this function helps you download and install the package on GitHub via the 
proxy website <https://ghproxy.com/> or <https://gh-proxy.com/>, which is in 
real-time sync with GitHub.

## Installation

``` r
# Install development version from GitLab
remotes::install_gitlab("chuxinyuan/ipkg")
# Install from CRAN
install.packages("ipkg")
```

## Usage

Install the development version of the R package on GitHub. Take the 'xfun' package as an example.

``` r
install_github("yihui/xfun")
```

Download file from GitHub via the proxy website. for example:

``` r
download_file(
 url = "https://github.com/hadley/mastering-shiny/raw/main/neiss/products.tsv",
 destfile = "products.tsv",
 quiet = TRUE
)
```
